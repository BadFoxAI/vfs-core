# DRE Roadmap: The Path to C Bootstrap

## Completed
- [x] Phase 1-4: Deterministic VM Substrate & Custom ABI.
- [x] Phase 5: Bootstrap Language (v0) & File IO.
- [x] Phase 6: POSIX Shim (stdio.h / putchar).
- [x] Phase 7: Self-Hosting (Builder -> Bin -> Exec).
- [x] Phase 8: Hardening (Bounds checking & Gas metering).
- [x] Big Bite 1-3: AST, Scoping, Memory.
- [x] Big Bite 4: THE IGNITION (Sovereignty Achieved).
  - [x] Compiler Substrate (Loops, Strings, Byte-Memory).
  - [x] If/Else control flow.
  - [x] Tokenizer in C-subset.
  - [x] Parser & Code Generator in C-subset.
  - [x] Full Pipeline Simulation.

## End of Line
DRE is now fully deterministic, feature-complete, and self-hosting capable.
